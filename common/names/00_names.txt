### Names generation for aces ###
# Surnames can be male/female dependent or general. Fe. in Polish some surnames has different endings depending on the gender.
# Names and Surnames are randomly picked and will sometimes repeat, but will never repeat in combinations for example there will never be generated another "John Smith".
# Assigning the callsign is random - may be assigned or not. If we use the callsign, it will never be assigned to anyone again. Callsigns are not obligatory to script.
# Picking up a gender is random, and is influenced by the amount of names scripted.
### Operations
# Operations will randomly pick from national pools until exhausted
# You can specify a strategic region for which an order name will be drawn
# if any enemy province along the frontline matches this strategic region, this sub-pool will be considered and used in preference to default.
# Whether this 'historical' name pool is exhausted is dependent on the define: HISTORICAL_ORDER_NAME_EXHAUSTION
# Strategic region index '0' is the generic national pool.
# You can specify the same name in several regions, though I would suggest not doing this too often, for performance reasons.
# After this, a first and second will be randomly picked from the default pool
# The prefix must be provided for all pools
