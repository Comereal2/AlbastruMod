All of Rias is still in shock from the events that occurred, but the democracy survived and Emekri is already drafting propositions on how to deal with everything. A part of that includes disbanding the newely formed Grand Coalition, as the fascists won't be a threat from now on."

The region of Yentrok, know for their separatism, decided to declare independence from Rias the moment Riastok fell and all across Rias democrats are revolting. They will have to be taken care of, but first priority is securing the nation."
