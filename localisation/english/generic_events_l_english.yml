welcome_event.1.t: "Welcome!"
welcome_event.1.d: "Thank you for testing out the mod! It is currently a work in progress and is missing many planned features. Never the less, I hope you enjoy what we have created so far and share your feedback with us. Here are a few options you can pick from if you want to learn more, have fun! -Comereal"
welcome_event.1.a: "Tell me more about the history of the world"
welcome_event.1.b: "Placeholder nations?"
welcome_event.1.c: "Blah blah, let me play already!"
welcome_event.2.t: "World History"
welcome_event.2.d: "Before we start, I just wanted to give a brief overview of the world this mod is placed in. This is Albastru, a region first started in Nationstates, you as the player take over a nation at the very beginning of the region's roleplay, before our crazy shenenigans have happened. All of the nations across the map have been created by our wonderful participants and you can learn more about us in either our discord server or nationstates regional wikipedia. The last major event that happened in the world was the collapse of the Helios Empire, consisting of almost the entirety of Southern Helios, holding many colonies in Lomezia and Orium, it was the strongest nation in the world. Currently, it has been divided into territories of Riassi, Odezya and Altir. Apart from that, there are only minor differences in the development of world history, mostly due to time constraints, however fascism has spread differently, while monarchies are still common across the region. Some terrain may not be what you expect from our other maps, however some aspects of the region have been changed to fit the constraints of either the game or the size of the development team."
